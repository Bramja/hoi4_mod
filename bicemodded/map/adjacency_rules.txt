#Adjacency rules are special rules for adjacencies
#If smbd who is at war fights over canal/strait it is considered closed
#Enemy status is considered if any of sides controlling the chanel is at war with country
#Friend status is considered non of sides controlling the chanel is at war with country and one of controllers is ally of giving military access
#Every one else is considered as neutral according to canal/strait
#Military access considered as being friend
#Rules needs linking from the straits that are affected by the rule ( adjacency_rule_id )

#Name is how you refer to the rule in adjecencies.csv
