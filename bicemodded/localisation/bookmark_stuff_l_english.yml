 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Once the most powerful nation on the face of the Earth, China has been brought low by nearly a century of western imperialism and internal strife.\n\nChiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang, the central government of China, now face threats from both the Japanese Empire, which has already annexed a vast swath of China, and Mao’s Communists, who are currently holed up in the hills of Shaanxi.

In the mountainous terrain of the interior, Chinese armies, their hearts filled with vengeance, charge Japanese forces, determined to drive the devils back into the sea. If China has to pay the blood price for her freedom, then so be it."
