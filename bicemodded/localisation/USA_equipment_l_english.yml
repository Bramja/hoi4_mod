american_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed by Rock Island Arsenal for the U.S. Cavalry, the M1 Combat Car was a tank designed in 1935.

american_light_tank_equipment_5_desc:0 "Due to a demand for radial engines, the M3 Stuart was modified to employ 2 V8 Cadillac engines and designated M5.

american_light_tank_equipment_6_desc:0 "The Chaffee came in to service near the end of World War II and was designed to replace the M3/M5 Stuart. In Africa, the M3 Stuart struggled to pierce Axis armor with its weak 37mm gun. To remedy this, the M24 was designed with a powerful 75mm gun which proved sufficient against Axis medium armor. It was about as fast as the M5 Stuart with a top speed of 35 mph (56kph)."

The M41, designed by Cadillac in 1949, fulfilled the need for a new light tank and went into production in 1951. It was armed with a 76mm main gun which was sufficient for disabling most light and medium AFVs of the period. It had 25mm armor on both the front and side, and he turret mantle had 38mm of armor. It weighed 23.5 tons, but it could still achieve a top speed of 45 mph (72kph). This was due to its powerful Continental 6 cylinder 500 HP engine."
