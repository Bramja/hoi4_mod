With the threat of a large scale conflict in the future, it may be wise to assume control of these militias and integrate them into our command structure so that if our great Royal Navy fails, we can organize a proper defense against the enemy instead of whatever the local government scrambles together. Of course, if you trust in the Royal Navy to protect our holdings, have good faith in the territorial governments, or just cannot be bothered with such tedium, it may be wise to leave things how they are."
