The Mark II was equipped with a 3pdr gun ( 47mm L/32) and four machine guns in the turret. The back of the turret had a slope so that the rear machine gun could be used against aircraft. There were two Vickers machine guns, one in each side of the hull to the rear. Its armour was the same 6,25mm and the 90 HP engine allowed the 12 ton tank a top road speed of 24 km/h."

 medium_uk_tank_equipment_0_desc:0 "In 1936, the British War Office designated two different kinds of tanks for future development: heavily armoured infantry tanks and fast mobile cruiser tanks. Due to the cost, in 1934, Vickers-Armstrong was asked for a "reasonably cheap tank" to replace the current medium models. The pilot model A9E1 was finished in 1936 . It was the first British tank to have a centrally located turret and to have powered traverse. Many armour faces were vertical with a maximum of 14mm and there were numerous shot traps, but it carried the new high velocity QF 2-pounder (40 mm) gun (also lacking a HE round like the matilda) and a coaxial Vickers machine gun, there were two small turrets either side of the driver's compartment, each with a Vickers machine-gun. Both of these smaller turrets were permanently manned, which gave the tank a total crew of six. The A9 weighed 12 tons, and with a AEC engine developing 150 HP it reached a top road speed of 40 km/h."

The A10 specification called for rivetted armour of up to 25mm and a speed of 16 km/h.The two sub-turrets present on the A9 were removed, and extra armour bolted onto that already present on the front and sides of the hull, along with all faces of the turret, providing approximately twice the armour in most areas. The A10 was two tonnes heavier than the A9, but used the same 150 HP engine, and therefore top road speed was down to 26 km/h. The main armament remained the QF 2-pounder (40-mm) gun and a coaxial .303 Vickers machine gun. The tank had now a crew of five."

However when someone from the War Office witnessed demonstrations of Soviet tank designs, including the BT tank, using a Christie suspension and the use of a lightweight aircraft engine, trials began for improvement of the Cruiser. Extensively redesigned, enlarged and with several faults rectified that Christie had not addressed, the Cruiser III was developed. It was determined, that it had to have a 30mm armour, a 2-pounder gun and a top road speed of 48 km/h for the A13. Finally the Mk.III had a weight of 14 tons, a crew of four, a 340 HP engine and far superior cross country performance than any british tank before. The Mk.IV had a few improvements in armour and a BESA machine gun but nothing decisive. The existing Mk.III were partially upgraded to the Mk.IV."

 medium_uk_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "After the Covenanter and the new Crusader I and II brought not much improvement to the british Cruiser Fleet the Crusader III was finally able to match the intermediate german Pz III and IV types. It was not based on the Covenanter but rather a parallel development. Unlike earlier "Christie cruisers"  the Crusader had five road wheels each side to improve weight distribution in a tank that weighed almost 20 tons instead of the 14 tons of the previous cruisers. Both the Covenanter and Crusader used the same main turret, however due to the larger gun the crew was reduced to three men. For armament the Crusader III received a 6 pounder ( 57mm L/43 ) gun, but still there was no HE shell for this gun, which led to the same problems vs. AT-guns as before. Saving grace for the Crusader was the efficient mechanism to fire on the move, allowing a few tactical maneuvers to gain the upper hand. Its 340 HP Mk.IV Liberty engine allowed a top road speed of 42 km/h."

The Cromwell was the first tank put into service by the British to combine high speed from a powerful and reliable engine (the Rolls-Royce Meteor also used in the Spitfire), 76mm hull and turret armour. It underwent various development variants, like the Cavalier and Centaur until the final Cromwell emerged. The intended dual-purpose high velocity gun could not be fitted in the turret and the 6 pdr gun which was fitted instead proved inadequate. The new APDS ammunition helped with that, but it did not solve the problem of inadequate HE shells which made attacking soft targets difficult. It weighed 27 tons and with its Meteor engine developing 540 HP a top road speed of 75 km/h could be achieved. This was way beyond what the chassis and suspension could handle so it was  governed to a maximum of 65 km/h."

It was using welding from the start and increased quality and thickness of the frontal armour to 79mm. Many older Cromwells were rebuild to the VII or VIII ( in case of 95mm armed CS vehicles ) standards.

It was designed as an improvement on the earlier Cromwell tank, mounting the new 77mm HV L/50 gun in a new lower profile and part-cast turret. This gun was effective against late-war German tanks, including the Panther at medium range, and occasionally, at close range, the Tiger. The tank was widely respected as one of the best British tanks of the war. The Comet, which was a development of the Cromwell, rendered the Challenger obsolete, and ultimately led to the development of the Centurion tank. When firing APDS rounds, the 77mm HV was slightly superior in armour penetration capability to the 75mm KwK 42 gun of the equivalent Axis tank, the Panther. The hull armour was 74mm and the partially sloped turret armour was 57 to 102mm. With a weight of 33,5 tons and a Meteor III engine developing 600 HP its top road speed was 51 km/h."

These were fitted with an open fighting compartment onto which an 18-pounder field gun was fitted with a 360-degree traverse. There were three versions of the Birch Gun, the first with an exposed driver position, the second with a semi-enclosed driver position and the third had a completely enclosed driver seat and a huge gun shield that almost fully enclosed the rest of the fighting compartment. Neither of the three versions met any interest in the army, however in 1938 the interest was finally awakened and the second version was chosen to produce using the many available chassis of the obsolete tanks."

The 17 pounder anti-tank gun ( 76,2mm L/55) was very powerful but also very large and heavy and could only be moved by a vehicle, which made the gun more effective in defence than in the attack. The engine in the Archer had a higher power rating than in the Valentine. Since the Valentine was too small, the gun was mounted in a simple, low, open-topped armoured box, very much like the early Panzerjäger German self-propelled guns, with the gun facing to the rear, which kept the overall length of the Archer short. On firing, the gun breech recoiled into the driver's space, with the driver staying crouched in position, in case the vehicle needed to move quickly. The rear mounting combined with its low silhouette made the Archer an excellent ambush weapon, allowing its crew to fire, then drive away without turning round."

It mounted the QF 17-pounder anti-tank gun on a Cromwell chassis to add anti-tank firepower to the cruiser tank units. The design compromises made in fitting the large gun onto the Cromwell chassis resulted in a tank with a powerful weapon but reduced armour. To fit the larger weapon and additional crewman in the turret, a much larger turret than that of the Cromwell was developed separately. Due to the weight of the 17-pounder, an extra wheel station and suspension arm was needed, lengthening the hull. This change in length, reduced mobility compared to the Cromwell, although speed remained high at 50 km/h. To limit the weight, the turret armour was reduced,, 63mm on the turret front and 40mm on the sides. As the base of the turret was unprotected, a jacking feature was fitted to clear jams. "

 medium_uk_tank_aa_equipment_2_desc:0 "The regular Crusader turret was replaced with a different square-shaped open top turret housing a single Bofors QF 2-pdr. (40mm L/60) anti-aircraft gun with an autoloader and powered mounting. The crew numbered four: gun commander, gun layer, loader, and driver. The relatively slow firing rate of the Mk.I with 120 rounds/minute and the maximum practical ceiling of 3800m made it a mediocre design, which led to the development of the Crusader AA Mk.II/III"

 medium_uk_tank_aa_equipment_3_desc:0 "For anti-aircraft protection a Crusader chassis was fitted with a different turret mounting twin Oerlikon 20mm guns and a single .303 Vickers GO machine gun. The turret was a small polygonal turret with heavy armour, but poor situational visibility for spotting approaching aircraft. The Mk III only differed from the Mk II by the position of the radio, which was moved to the hull in order to free some space inside the turret. In regards to protection it was felt to be a better mount than the Mk.I, and the practical rate of fire with 250-320 rounds/minute each increased massively compared to the slow firing single Bofors 40mm, but its effective combat ceiling suffered at being 900m. So a mix of both designs were preferred to be able to combat low and medium height targets."

The configuration was identical but the gun was installed higher to have a platform for 360° Operation. As with the gun carrier, the crew was unprotected during 360° action, there were foldable skirts and they could be folded up for protection but then only with the gun facing forward or backward. The gun had a rate of fire of 16-18 rpm and an effective ceiling of 5000 m."

 heavy_uk_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "In 1924 the General Staff of the British Army ordered the prototype of a heavy tank, which became known as the Independent A1E1. It was a 33 ton multi-turret design, having a central gun turret armed with a 3 pounder gun (47 mm L/32), and four subsidiary turrets each armed with a 7,7mm Vickers machine gun. The subsidiary turrets were mounted two at the front and two to the rear of the. The gun of the left rear turret was able to elevate to engage aircraft. The tank was designed to have heavy firepower, self-defence capability, and superiority to enemy weapons. Its armour was very thin at a maximum of 38mm, but was increased with the production models. It also incorporated a new hydraulic braking system which had to be specially developed due to its weight and speed. The V12 air-cooled engine developed 370 HP and allowed a top road speed of 32 km/h."

 heavy_uk_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Even though the Churchill tanks were considered heavy tanks, they were designed as slow Infantry support tanks. A different attempt to create a reasonably mobile heavy tank was the Excelsior. It mounted a 17pounder (76,2mm L/55) gun, which was less powerful than the german 75mm L/70, but still sufficient to penetrate 130mm armour at 1000m. The Cromwell hull and turret with extra armour and the track and suspension of the 50-ton US M6 Heavy Tank which had been developed for both US and British was used. It was built with a widened Cromwell track and suspension by LMS and different armoured skirts. It only superficially resembled the Churchills. The design was armed with an Ordnance QF 75mm gun. Although it had a strong frontal armour of 114mm, its inner side armour was very weak at 31mm plus the 25mm skirts.  Its Rolls Royce Meteor engine provided 600 HP which allowed the 41 ton tank a maximum road speed of 38 km/h."

 heavy_uk_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Developed from the Valiant I infantry tank which was one of the worst designed tanks ever, trying to achieve a maximum armour at the lowest possible weight ( similar in principle to the Mathilda I ) and sacrificing all other aspects. However the follow up model called the Valiant II or heavy Valiant was a different beast.  It was based on a redesigned Excelsior hull, its redesigned weight with the enlarged turret was 45 tons.  Its frontal armour was quite heavy at 228mm and its frontal turret had even 254mm. It featured a similar piked prow as later seen on the IS-3. At first it mounted a 94mm Howitzer in the original Valiant I turret, but as this was quite useless against other tanks it was later switched to a 32 pounder (94mm L/50) gun in a redesigned and enlarged turret. Its insufficient 400 HP Rolls Royce Meteorite engine was upgraded to a 600 HP V8 Meteor engine which  allowed a top road speed of 30 km/h although the mobility still wasn´t great."

 heavy_uk_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "1944 the development of the „A45 Infantry Support Tank“ was started at  around the same time as the A41 Centurion. Abandoning the slow Infantry Tank concept, the "Universal Tank or MBT" concept was to design a vehicle with a mobility comparable to that of cruiser tanks, but with the armour and firepower of heavy tanks. The FV 200 series was adopted and was to serve as a multi-purpose line of AFV that used the same hull and chassis. The Caernavon II was a FV 201 chassis fitted with a 20-pounder gun in a Centurion Mk.III turret ( as the initially proposed 17 pounder gun was outdated). However as the Centurion Mk.III versions later proved to be superior to the Caernavon the chassis was used for developing the even heavier Conqueror MBT. The hull was rather weakly armoured with 76mm sloped armour but the turret had armour of 127mm. It weighed 55 tons and with its Meteor engine developing 800 HP a top road speed of 34 km/h was achieved."

 medium_uk_tank_equipment_6_desc:0 "Developed in 1943 as A41, a new design for a heavy cruiser tank. After a series of fairly mediocre designs in the A series, and bearing in mind the threat posed by the German 88 mm gun, the War Office demanded a major revision of the design requirements. Initially planned to weigh no more than  41 tons, the final L7 105mm L/52 armed version Mk.III weighed 52 tons instead.  A high top speed was not considered important, while agility was to be equal to that of the Comet using the same Meteor engine. So the new design had excellent performance and a top road speed of 35 km/h. It had a larger hull by adapting the long-travel five-wheel Christie suspension used on the Comet with the addition of a sixth wheel and a simpler Horstmann suspension. The turret had 127mm of armour and the hull was redesigned with welded, sloped armour with a maximum of 110mm. The Centurion finally realized the “universal tank / MBT” principle begun with the Caernavon."

 heavy_uk_tank_equipment_6_desc:0 "The FV 214 Conqueror, also known as "Tank, Heavy No. 1, 120 mm Gun, Conqueror" was developed as a response to the latest german tanks and the soviet Joseph Stalin IS-3heavy tanks; its 120 mm gun was larger than the 105mm gun carried by the Centurion. The Conqueror's role was to provide long range anti-tank support for the Centurion. The chassis was from the A 45 Infantry Support Tank. The armour front armour of 178mm was very heavy for the time. Unfortunately along with the huge turret required for the large gun and very large hull volume, made it very heavy, cumbersome and mechanically unreliable. Also, few bridges could support its weight. However, rather like the Churchill tank, the Conqueror had exceptional terrain handling characteristics and proved to be as capable cross country as the lighter (and on paper slightly faster) Centurion tank. Its Rolls-Royce Meteor M120 engine with 810 HP gave the 64 tons tank a top road speed of 35 km/h."
