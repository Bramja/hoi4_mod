#Changelog since 3.7.17
#3.7.17 3 PM EST update:
#	New GFX for several leaders in Central Asia and some in Baltic States (whatever is missing from here will be in by tomorrow)
#	New GFX for JAP / ENG ships, some USA armor, JAP air tree
#	Considerable number of new states added – most are in Austria and Yugoslavia (to simulate historical occupations of these areas), but also added the Siliguri Corridor in India. Revised events like Anschluss and the Fate of Yugoslavia accordingly to implement new states
#	Huge number of strategic regions added with appropriate weather – much easier to micromanage planes. Attempted to target all very large air regions, added proper localization for all of these.
#	Japanese specialized factories should now give proper bonuses
#	Minor reworks to factory efficiency / production output
#	Some air stat rebalancing, but very minor
#	Increased cost and manpower of generic tree destroyers slightly
#	Changed some event mentions from “controls_state =” to “has_full_control_of_state =” to avoid weird niche event firing situations
#	A few more errors with duplicate gfx were removed
#3.7.17 8 PM EST update:
#	Added releasable Balkan countries of Slovenia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, & Macedonia (FYROM)
#	Revised a few errors with new strategic regions, states, OOBs, etc. 
#	CV aircraft balancing, nothing major here I believe
#	Continued work on American air tree, though it is still not enabled – balance issues
#	Fixed issue with Pressure Siam national focus that would do nothing when fired
#	Added GFX for some ships for JAP
#3.8.17 3 PM EST update:
#	US air tree enabled & rebalanced from vanilla BICE – generally speaking we pared in some of the weird-looking values and made some minor changes to fighter air attack; balancing is a work in progress and if you notice anything weird, say something in the bug reports or in mod workshop
#	Made some US divisions start under-strength to reflect their use as reserve prior to game period
#	Added US airplanes to unique air factories and to aircraft manufacturers

#3.8.17 9 PM EST update:
